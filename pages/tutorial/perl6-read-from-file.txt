As in other high level languages one has to open a file in order to read
from it or to write to it. In Perl 6 it is done by the open()
function imported from the IO class. It can receive several parameter
but thw two are very important:
The name of the file and the mode.
In order to open a file for reading the mode need to be :r.
The function either returns a file handle that should be placed in a
scalar variable or returns undef in case of failure.

<command>$fh = open $filename, :r</command>

Once we have an open file handler we can use the get method ($fh.get)
to read one line from the given file.

One could read many lines using consecutive calls to the get method
but there are better ways to do that.

Currently I think Rakudo throws an exception if the file cannot
be opened but I think the spec says that it should just return undef.

The specifications of all the IO of Perl 6 can be found in
S32-setting-library/IO.pod
