The equality operators in Perl 6 are == for comparing numerical values
and eq for comparing strings. The negated version are the same just with an
exclamation mark ( ! ) in front of them. So the would look like !== and !eq.

Luckily those both have their own Short-cut version that are spelled
!= and ne as one, at least with Perl 5 background, would expect.


Other operators too have negated versions so you can write
!>=  which means less than (for numbers) and you can write
!ge  which is the same for strings. I am not fully sold why do we need thes.


One advantage I can see is that if you create an operator called I
then you will automatically get one that looks like !I which would
be its negation.
