Perl 6 has a large set of special variables. In order to
make it easy to differentiate them from regular variables,
they are marked with a second prefix called twigil.

Regular, user defined variables have a sigil ($, @ or %) in front of them.

System variables have and additional character between the sigil
and the name of the variable.

Examples:
<ul>
 <li><emp>$*PROGRAM-NAME</emp> relative path to the currently running Perl 6 script.</li>
 <li><emp>$*PROGRAM</emp> full path to the currently running Perl 6 cript</li>
 <li><emp>$*CWD</emp> contains a path to the current working directory.</li>
 <li><emp>$*IN</emp> is the standard input (STDIN). You can read a line using $*IN.get</li>
 <li><emp>@*INC</emp> search path for modules.</li>
 <li><emp>$*PID</emp> Process ID</li>
 <li><emp>$EXECUTABLE_NAME</emp> Relative path to the current binary. Most likely <b>perl6</b></li>
 <li><emp>$EXECUTABLE</emp> Full path to <b>perl6</b></li>
 <li><emp>$*TMPDIR</emp> ??</li>

</ul>
