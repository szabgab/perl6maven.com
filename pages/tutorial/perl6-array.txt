Arrays start with am at mark <emp>@</emp> and the name of the array.
You can assign a list of values to the array.

Printing the array as is, shows them with no space between them.
One can also put the arry within a string (interpolating) but then
it needs to be enclosed in {} curly braces. This will print spaces
between the values.

The for loop lets you iterate through the values of the array.

As you can see the parentheses () around the list values
are optional.
