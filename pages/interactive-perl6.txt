When learning Perl 6 one of the best things you can do is to experiment with the language in the interactive shell.
(Also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL = Read Eval Print Loop</a>)

Once you have <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo Perl 6</a> installed open a Terminal (or Command Prompt in MS Windows)
and type in <b>perl6</b>. After a second or so you will see:

=abstract end

<code>
To exit type 'exit' or '^D'
>
</code>

(TBD: Is this the same on Windows?)

The &gt; sign is the prompt. You can now type in any Perl 6 expression.
Let's start with a few simple ones:

<code>
> say "hello world"
hello world
> say 42
42
> 19 + 23
42
</code>

<hl>say</hl> is the keyword to <b>print</b> something to the screen and add a trailing newline.

Strings are in double-quotes. Numbers don't have quotes.

We can use Perl 6 as a calculator. In the interactve shell we don't even need to call <b>say</b>
as it will automatiaclly print the result of the last statement. (The P is in the name REPL for a reason.)


<h2>Variables</h2>

Most variables in Perl 6 have one or two special characters at the beginning. The first such character is called
Sigil, the secoond, optional character is called Twigil.

The <hl>$</hl> sigil means the variable can contain any item.
Let's try to assign a number to a variable that starts with a <hl>$</hl>:

<code>
> $x = 42
===SORRY!=== Error while compiling:
Variable '$x' is not declared
------> <BOL>⏏$x = 42
</code>

Even the interactive shell requires us to declare our variables using the <hl>my</hl> keyword:

<code>
> my $x = 42
42
> $x
42
> $x - 7
35
</code>

After the declaration and the assignment we can use the variable in arithmetic operations.

Using the <hl>WHAT</hl> method we can also ask the variable what type is it. In this case it is of type <hl>Int</hl>:

<code>
> $x.WHAT
(Int)
</code>


We can replace the content of the variable with a string, and then, when we ask <b>WHAT</b>
is it, we get back that it is a <b>Str</b>.

<code>
> $x = "abc"
abc

> $x.WHAT
(Str)
</code>

Some people love this kind of flexibility, for others this looks crazy dangerous. Don't worry,
In Perl 6 ou can be much stricter with your variable types during declaration. If that's your thing:

<code>
> my Int $w = 42
42
> $w.WHAT
(Int)

> $w = "hello"
Type check failed in assignment to $w; expected Int but got Str ("hello")
  in block <unit> at <unknown file> line 1

>
</code>

In this case we've declared the $w variable to be <hl>Int</hl> so we won't be able to
assign any other type to it.


Back to our type declaration free variable, you can put all kind of other types in that variable:

<code>
> $x = 3.14
3.14
> $x.WHAT
(Rat)

> $x = ["foo", "bar", "qux"]
[foo bar qux]
> $x.WHAT
(Array)

> $x = ("foo", "bar", "qux")
(foo bar qux)
> $x.WHAT
(List)

> $x = {name => "Foo", answer => 42}
{answer => 42, name => Foo}
> $x.WHAT
(Hash)

> $x = name => "Foo"
name => Foo
> $x.WHAT
(Pair)
</code>


We'll look at these types later on.

<h2>Pair</h2>

<code>
> $x = name => "Foo"
name => Foo
> $x.WHAT
(Pair)
> $x.gist
name => Foo
> $x.key
name
> $x.value
Foo
</code>

<h2>Hash</h2>

A Hash is a key-value store. In other languages it might be called <hl>Associative Array</hl> or <hl>Dictionary</hl>.

We can create a hash using curly-braces and assigning it to a variable starting with a <hl>$</hl>:

<code>
> my $x = {name => "Foo", answer => 42};
{answer => 42, name => Foo}
</code>

It is a hash:

<code>
> $x.WHAT
(Hash)
</code>

We can access the values of the individual keys both with quotes around the keys:

<code>
> $x{"name"}
Foo
> $x{"answer"}
42
</code>

And without any quotes:

<code>
> $x&lt;name>
Foo
> $x&lt;answer>
42
</code>

We can fetch the <hl>keys</hl> of the hash and the <hl>values</hl>
separately:

<code>
> $x.keys
(name answer)

> $x.values
(Foo 42)
</code>

What <hl>keys</hl> really returns is a <hl>Seq</hl> (Sequence) object:

<code>
> my $z = $x.keys
(name answer)
> $z.WHAT
(Seq)
</code>

We can also iterate over the individual keys using the <hl>for</hl> loop.
($k is the loop variable that will get each key on its turn.)

<code>
> for $x.keys -> $k { say $k }
name
answer
</code>

Using the keys we can access the respective values:

<code>
> for $x.keys -> $k { say $k; say $x{$k} }
name
Foo
answer
42
</code>

Alternatively we can fetch a list of <hl>pairs</hl>
and on each <hl>Pair</hl> object we can call the <hl>key</hl>
and the <hl>value</hl> methods:

<code>
> for $x.pairs -> $p { say $p.WHAT; say $p.key; say $p.value}
(Pair)
name
Foo
(Pair)
answer
42
</code>


<h2>List</h2>

If we wrap the right-hand side in parenthese we het a <hl>List</hl>
on the left-hand side:

<code>
> $x = ("foo", "bar", "qux")
(foo bar qux)
> $x.WHAT
(List)
</code>

In order to iterate over its elements we need to call the <hl>list</hl>
method on it:

<code>
> for $x.list -> $v { say $v }
foo
bar
qux
</code>

<h2>Array</h2>

If we put square brackets around the values on the right-hand side, we 
get an <hl>Array</hl>

<code>
> $x = ["foo", "bar", "qux"]
[foo bar qux]
> $x.WHAT
(Array)
</code>

Here too we need to call the <hl>list</hl> method in order to iterate over the elements:

<code>
> for $x.list -> $i { say $i }
foo
bar
qux
</code>
